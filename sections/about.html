    <h3>
        There are forces older than time, lurking in the spaces between what is seen and what is known.
        <br>
        They shape the world in silence, twisting the fates of gods and mortals alike. 
        <br>
        Their touch is subtle… until it isn’t.
    </h3>

        In The Weaver Chronicles, power is never without cost, and survival is not the same as salvation. This is a tale of humanity’s descent into the unknown—where ambition births ruin, where love is both a weapon and a curse, and where the greatest horrors do not come from the dark, but from those who dare to reach beyond it.</p>
        As the series unfolds, the veil between reality and nightmare frays. Sanity is tested. Flesh is reshaped. And the mind is left to question whether endurance is an act of strength—or the slow acceptance of damnation.</p>
        <br>
        <strong>This is not a story of heroes.</strong> 
        <br>    
        It is a story of choices. Of suffering. Of the thin, trembling thread between light and abyss—and what happens when it finally snaps.
        <br>
        A saga of psychological, physical, and cosmic horror, The Weaver Chronicles explores the depths of human depravity, the unbearable weight of existence, and the cost of defying the inevitable.
        <br>
        <strong>It asks: What will be left of them if they do?</strong>
        <strong>Enter the darkness. Read at your own risk.</strong>
