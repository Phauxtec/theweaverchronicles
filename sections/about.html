            There are forces older than time, lurking in the spaces between what is seen and what is known.

            Their touch is subtle… until it isn’t.
            <br>
            In The Weaver Chronicles, power is never without cost, and survival is not the same as salvation. 
            <br>
            This is a tale of humanity’s descent into the unknown—where ambition births ruin, where love is both a weapon and a curse, and where the greatest horrors do not come from the dark, but from those who dare to reach beyond it.</p>
