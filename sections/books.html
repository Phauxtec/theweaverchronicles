        <strong>A Destiny Woven in Shadows. A Fate That Refuses to Be Tamed.</strong>
    </h2>
    <br>
    Before Sarel takes her first breath, <strong>destiny wages war for her soul.</strong>  
    Born beneath a storm that fractures the earth and a ritual that reshapes fate,  
    she is bound to forces beyond her understanding.  
    <br><br>
    For years, she knows nothing of the power that lingers beneath her skin,  
    content with the quiet life of Emberdale and the love of Karl—  
    the boy who has always been her safe harbor.  
    <br><br>
    But when a strange illness consumes Karl,  
    turning his very essence against him, 
    <strong>Sarel’s world fractures.</strong>
    The answers she seeks lie beyond the veil of history—  
    in whispers of forgotten gods, lost Weavers,  
    and the unbreakable threads of fate that bind them all.  
    <br><br>
    To save the man she loves, 
    <strong>Sarel must step into a world where magic is both a gift and a curse,</strong>
    where bargains come at terrible costs,  
    and where the gods do not forgive those who defy them.  
    As she unravels the truth of her birth, her power,  
    and the darkness stirring beneath the surface of the world,  
    she will be forced to answer the one question that could unmake everything:
    <br><br>
    <strong>How far will she go to defy fate?</strong>  
    <br><br>
    <strong>And can love truly stand against the will of the gods?</strong>  
    <br><br>
