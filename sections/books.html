        A <span class="gold"> Destiny</span> Woven Into the Very Fabrics of <span class="purple">Shadow</span>.
    </h2>
        <br>
        Before Sarel takes her first breath, her <Strong>fate</Strong> is rewritten by forces older than time.
        <br><br>
        Born beneath a storm that fractures the earth and a ritual that reshapes destiny, she is bound to a power 
        she does not yet understand.
        <br><br>
        In the quiet town of Emberdale, she knows nothing of the magic woven into her soul—only the warmth of Karl, 
        the boy who has always been her safe harbor. 
        <br><br>
        But when a terrible illness consumes Karl from the inside out, his very essence turning against him, Sarel’s 
        world unravels. 
        <br><br>
        Desperate to save him, she follows a trail of forbidden knowledge, uncovering whispers of forgotten 
        gods, and the ancient magic that has shaped the world in silence.  
        <br><br>
        Yet power is never without cost. To save Karl, she must enter a world where fate is a cage, where the gods punish 
        those who defy them, and where magic does not grant mercy—it demands sacrifice. 
        <br><br>
        As she unearths the truth of her birth, her gift, and the darkness awakening beneath the world, she faces a choice that will determine more than Karl’s fate.
        <br><br>
        <strong>Because some destinies cannot be escaped. And some fires refuse to be tamed.</strong>
        <br><br>
        Shadow of the Dragon is the first tale in The Weaver Chronicles, an epic dark fantasy saga exploring fate, forbidden power, and the fine line between salvation and ruin.
